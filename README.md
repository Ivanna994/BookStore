This is a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. The API provides CRUD operations for the "Book" entity and a search functionality that allows searching books by title and author with pagination support. The API is built using .NET 6, Entity Framework Core (code-first), and SQL Server. It also includes an embedded Swagger page for easy testing and documentation.

I did not fully complete the authentication, authorization and docker support and therefore it was not submitted.
